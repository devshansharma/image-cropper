# image-cropper

Just a simple image cropper for my website. Cropping is done with the help of canvas. Have used self executing anonymous function, so data is passed by custom attributes in canvas tag.

Have tried to make things only come with canvas custom attributes.

No third party libraries, except jQuery, and that's too for only showing and hiding the bootstrap modal for canvas. You can remove Bootstrap and jQuery as per your needs.
